# Multi-tool-assessment-of-EA
The repository contains classifications of interactive functions that were used to assess the functionality (set of interactive functions) of two electronic atlases: Digital Atlas of Belgium (https://www.atlas-belgique.be/index.php) and Population of Ukraine and its natural and cultural heritage (http://spad.igu.org.ua). Each classification was used as an assessment tool and contains the results of the assessment.
